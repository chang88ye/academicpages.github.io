Dr Shouyong Jiang is a computater scientist who specialises in AI solutions for complex optimisation and decision making environments. 

He is currently an assistant professor at the Department of Computing Science, University of Aberdeen. Prior to that, He was a lectuer and member of the MLearn group at University of Lincoln, a programme lead of MSc Data Science and Applications, and carried out research in machine learning and big data analytics for optimal greenhouse climate control (energy, CO2 emssion and crop yield). He worked in the Interdisciplinary Computing and Complex BioSystems (ICOS) group, at Newcastle Univeristy, as a postdoc researcher on the giant Portabolomics project (Â£7.5m) from 2017 to 2019. He is passionate about artificial intelligence and has actively worked on computational teachniques for interdisciplinary applications, e.g., systems metabolic engineering, biotechnology, agri-food, etc.
